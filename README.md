# Coffee Sales Data Analysis Project

## Project Overview
This project showcases my proficiency in Excel as a powerful data analysis tool. Through this project, I demonstrate various techniques in data manipulation, cleaning, and visualization. 

The dataset used is sourced from Mo Chen's GitHub repository (Mo Chen is a data analyst and YouTuber). You can find the data source [here](https://github.com/mochen862/excel-project-coffee-sales/blob/main/coffeeOrdersData.xlsx).
